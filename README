WeeChat script for Off-the-Record messaging

DISCLAIMER: To the best of my knowledge this script securely provides OTR
messaging in WeeChat, but I offer no guarantee. Please report any security
holes you find.

Still a few bugs but all the basics are working.

Installation:

Requires python-otr 0.2.2 which has not been officially released yet. Until
it is released:

wget http://python-otr.pentabarf.de/releases/python-otr-0.2.1.1.tar.gz
tar xvzf python-otr-0.2.1.1.tar.gz
cd python-otr-0.2.1.1
wget http://python-otr.pentabarf.de/releases/patches/python-otr-0.2.2.patch
patch -p0 < python-otr-0.2.2.patch
sudo python setup.py install

To install script:

Copy weechat_otr.py to ~/.weechat/python/

Then either symlink it into ~/.weechat/python/autload
or '/python load python/weechat_otr.py' in WeeChat
