WeeChat script for Off-the-Record messaging

DISCLAIMER: To the best of my knowledge this script securely provides OTR
messaging in WeeChat, but I offer no guarantee. Please report any security
holes you find.

Still a few bugs but all the basics are working.

Requires python-otr http://python-otr.pentabarf.de/
On Debian-based distros sudo apt-get install python-otr

To install:

Copy weechat_otr.py to ~/.weechat/python/

Then either symlink it into ~/.weechat/python/autload
or '/python load python/weechat_otr.py' in WeeChat
