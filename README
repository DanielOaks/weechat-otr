WeeChat script for Off-the-Record messaging

This script is under active development and many features have not been
implemented yet. It has not been tested very much or audited for security.

It requires the pure Python OTR implementation (potr):

Thanks to Kjell Braden for the Python OTR library and the Gajim Python plugin
which I used as a reference.

To install script:

Copy weechat_otr.py to ~/.weechat/python/

Then either symlink it into ~/.weechat/python/autload
or '/python load python/weechat_otr.py' in WeeChat
